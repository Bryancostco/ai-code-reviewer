# AI Code Reviewer

This is a personal project Iâ€™m building to learn how to connect Python with SQL while also experimenting with AI.  
The idea is simple: users can paste code, and the app will store it, run an AI review, and keep track of all the feedback in a database.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- MySQL
- (Future) Docker + React

## Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a `.env` file with your database credentials
3. Run `python db_test.py` to test the connection
